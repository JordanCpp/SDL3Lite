# SDL3Lite - Simple Directmedia Layer Version 3 Lite

This is a lightweight implementation of the SDL3 library. 

I really like the SDL3 library, but it saddens me that with each release of a new version, support for older systems is removed. 
Therefore, I decided to write a simpler version compatible at the API level. 
To support old and new systems, architectures, and operating systems.
The project is being developed in C++98. 
This makes the code very portable.
