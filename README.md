# SDL3Lite - Simple Directmedia Layer Version 3 Lite

SDL3Lite is a lightweight, portable implementation of the SDL3 library, created with a single goal:  
**To write fast, clear, and modern code that works everywhere — from old retro computers to the latest systems.**

I love the SDL3 library, but with each new version, support for older systems is often dropped.  
SDL3Lite aims to be API-compatible, supporting both old and new systems, architectures, and operating systems.  
Developed in C++98 for maximum portability.

## SDL3Lite Manifest
We believe that good code is code that:
- Is clear and easy to read and maintain.
- Is fast and efficient on any hardware — from retro computers to modern PCs.
- Stands the test of time and platforms: it compiles and runs on both old and new systems.
- Does not require heavy dependencies or complex tools.
- Enables learning, experimentation, and creativity, without limiting the developer’s imagination.

SDL3Lite is our contribution to the continuity of generations of programmers.
We prove that a modern API and clean style can coexist with support for old hardware, and that minimalism and portability are not a compromise, but a path to true craftsmanship.

## SDL3Lite:
- Is compatible with the SDL3 API (as much as possible).
- Does not require heavy dependencies.
- Easily builds for DOS, Windows, Linux, and other platforms.
- Is written in pure C++98 for maximum portability.
- Is suitable for learning, experimentation, porting classic games, and creating new projects from scratch.
Why does this matter?
Old hardware never loses its charm. It teaches us to value efficiency, minimalism, and control over our code.
SDL3Lite is a bridge between eras, a tool for those who want to create without limits of time or platform.
